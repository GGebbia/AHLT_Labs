# Laboratory 1: 	Rule-Based NERC
> In this lab we are aimed to read XML files, scan and detect the most relevant features of entities and create a rule-based model capable of learning when a sentence contains information of drug, drug_n (drugs not approved for human use), brands and groups.
>

## Main Scripts

The lab is divided in 2 goals, one with external knowledge and one without. For the case of no knowledge the script to be executed is: 
```
baseline-NER_goal1.py
```
and for the second case is:
```
baseline-NER_goal2.py
```
## Usage example

The user can execute the script simply by opening a terminal and writing: 
```
baseline-NER_goalX.py <path_to_the_data> 
```
A file with the expected results will be created (goldNer.txt) together with a log of the performance and a txt containing the predicted results.
